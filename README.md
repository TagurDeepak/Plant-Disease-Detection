# Leaf Disease Detection

## Introduction  
This project is a web-based deep learning application designed to detect plant leaf diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained to classify different types of plant diseases based on images of leaves from the PlantVillage dataset. The app is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to upload leaf images and receive real-time predictions.

## Features  
- Streamlit web interface for easy interaction  
- Real-time image prediction and result display  
- Pre-trained CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras  
- JSON-based class name loading for label flexibility  
- Supports `.jpg`, `.png`, and `.jpeg` image formats  
- Displays predicted disease class and confidence score  
- Error handling for invalid or missing input  
- Local deployment without requiring cloud infrastructure

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- TensorFlow  
- Keras  
- NumPy  
- Pillow (PIL)  
- Streamlit   

## Model Details  
- Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  
- Framework: TensorFlow Keras  
- Dataset: PlantVillage  
- Accuracy: Approximately 88.44% validation accuracy  
- Output: Disease class + Confidence score

**Note:**  
As it is not possible to upload the trained model file (`Plant_Disease_Prediction_Model.h5`) directly to this repository, here is the download link for it:
